            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Nick, an Information Technology student at <a href="https://swmich.edu" target="_blank">Southwestern
                    Michigan College</a>, where I’m working towards a degree in <a
                    href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/information_technology" target="_blank">Information
                    Technology</a>. From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by how technology works, and I love breaking
                things down to understand them and then building them back up in a better way.
            </p>
            <p>
                My educational journey has always been intertwined with my curiosity about how things function—whether
                it’s programming, networking, or tinkering with gadgets like Raspberry Pi’s and 3D printers. This site
                is my digital garden, where I can organize my thoughts, projects, and ideas.
